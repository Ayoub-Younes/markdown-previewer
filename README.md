This is a Markdown Previewer project created as part of my JavaScript Libraries certification from FreeCodeCamp. The project allows users to write and preview Markdown text in real time.

## Project Overview

The project supports various Markdown features such as headings, lists, links, code blocks, and more. The design features a responsive layout with a retro theme, custom fonts, and a simple yet effective interface that enhances the user experience.
